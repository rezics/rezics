## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Default realm seeding

The seed system SHALL create a single official default realm as a `Unit` with `type = REALM`, owned by the root seed user. The realm SHALL have `isPublic: true` and `isOfficial: true`, with `memberCount: 1` and the root user as owner member.

The seed SHALL import `DEFAULT_REALM` from `@rezics/contract` and use its `translations` record to create `UnitTranslation` rows. Translations SHALL be created for all languages defined in `DEFAULT_REALM.translations` (en, zh-hant, ja). The seed SHALL also create `UnitSupportLanguage` rows for all three languages.

The seed SHALL NOT hardcode translation strings — the contract is the single source of truth.

#### Scenario: First run — no official realm exists

- **WHEN** the seed script runs and no realm with `isOfficial: true` exists
- **THEN** the system creates the default realm with the root user as owner, with translations for en, zh-hant, and ja imported from `DEFAULT_REALM.translations`

#### Scenario: Subsequent run — official realm exists

- **WHEN** the seed script runs and an official realm already exists
- **THEN** the system skips creation and uses the existing realm's ID for EchoKV registration

#### Scenario: Translation languages match contract

- **WHEN** the seed creates the default realm
- **THEN** the number of `UnitTranslation` rows matches the number of keys in `DEFAULT_REALM.translations` (currently 3)
